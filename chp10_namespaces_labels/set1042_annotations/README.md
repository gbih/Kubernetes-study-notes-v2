# 10.4.2 Adding annotations to objects

### Objective

1. Explore how to add annotations to objects, both imperatively and declaratively

### Notes

* A good use of annotations is to add a description to each pod or other object so that other users can quickly see information about an object without having to look it up elsewhere.

* An annotation value can contain any character and can be up to 256 KB long.

* An annotation value must be a string, but contain plain text, YAML, JSON, or even Base64-Encoded value.
