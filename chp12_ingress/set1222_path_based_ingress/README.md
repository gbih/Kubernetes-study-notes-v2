# 12.2.2 Path-based ingress traffic routing


### Objective

1. Explore how an Ingress object can contain many rules and map multiple hosts and paths to multiple services. 


### Notes

* We are using two individual ingress objects, one for api-example-com and one for kiada-example-com.

* See the resemblance to routes in various web-app frameworks, such as React Router, Elixir's Phoenix Routing, Go's http.ServeMux, etc.
